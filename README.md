## Libft is a Library of Functions
First project of school 42. This project allows you to consolidate the achievements of the C pool.it is a question of recoding a certain number of functions of the standard C library as well as other functions which may prove useful afterwards. the file structure is the following :

## Header file
Your header file is useful for 2 things:
* First, instead of doing for example #include <unistd.h> in all of your .c files, you just write it once in your header and all of your .c files will read it from your header file.
* Secondly, let's say one of your .c files uses another function from another .c file, well instead of writting that function above, just write #include "libft.h" and it will find it in your header file.

Make sure you add #include "libft.h" in all of your source files. 

## Makefile
Makefile is where you will create a file to compile your projects. Remember how in the piscine, you created an int main and gcc to compile the projects, well with a Makefile, you don't have to do that anymore, you just type make once you have created your Makefile.

## Libft functions
* **ft_isalpha** - checks for an alphabetic character.
* **ft_isdigit** - checks for a digit (0 through 9).
* **ft_isalnum** - checks for an alphanumeric character.
* **ft_isascii** - checks whether c fits into the ASCII character set.
* **ft_isprint** - checks for any printable character.
* **ft_toupper** - convert char to uppercase.
* **ft_tolower** convert char to lowercase.
* **ft_memset** fill memory with a constant byte.
* **ft_strlen** calculate the length of a string.
* **ft_bzero** zero a byte string.
* **ft_memcpy** copy memory area.
* **ft_memmove** copy memory area.
* **ft_strlcpy** copy string to an specific size.
* **ft_strlcat** concatenate string to an specific size.
* **ft_strchr** locate character in string.
* **ft_strrchr** locate character in string. 
* **ft_strncmp** compare two strings.
* **ft_memchr** scan memory for a character.
* **ft_memcmp** compare memory areas.
* **ft_strnstr** locate a substring in a string.
* **ft_strdup** creates a dupplicate for the string passed as parameter.
* **ft_atoi** convert a string to an integer.
* **ft_calloc** allocates memory and sets its bytes' values to 0.
* **ft_substr** returns a substring from a string.
* **ft_strjoin** concatenates two strings.
* **ft_strtrim** trims the beginning and end of string with specific set of chars.
* **ft_split** splits a string using a char as parameter.
* **ft_itoa** converts a number into a string.
* **ft_strmapi** applies a function to each character of a string.
* **ft_striteri** applies a function to each character of a string.
* **ft_putchar_fd** output a char to a file descriptor.
* **ft_putstr_fd** output a string to a file descriptor.
* **ft_putendl_fd** output a string to a file descriptor, followed by a new line.
* **ft_putnbr_fd** output a number to a file descriptor.
## Linked list functions
* **ft_lstnew** creates a new list element.
* **ft_lstadd_front** adds an element at the beginning of a list.
* **ft_lstsize** counts the number of elements in a list.
* **ft_lstlast** returns the last element of the list.
* **ft_lstadd_back** adds an element at the end of a list.
